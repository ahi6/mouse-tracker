# Mouse stats tracker
This is a small app I made to learn [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). 
Upon its launch, it will record your mouse position and calculate stats such as distance travelled and the average speed.

## Running on Linux
This app requires `libxdo`.
On Ubuntu, this can be installed with `sudo apt-get install libxdo-dev`.
