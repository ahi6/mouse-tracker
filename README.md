# Mouse stats tracker
This is a small app I made to learn [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). 
Upon its launch, it will record your mouse position and calculate stats such as distance travelled and the average speed.

There is still a LOT to do â€” there is no persistence, it looks kind of ugly, etc.

## Running on Linux
This app requires `libxdo`.
On Ubuntu, this can be installed with `sudo apt-get install libxdo-dev`.

## Licence
This app is licenced under the [EUPL-1.2](LICENCE).
