# Mouse stats tracker
This is a small app I made to learn [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). 
Upon its launch, it will record your mouse position and calculate stats such as distance travelled and the average speed.

There is still room for improvement, but this program isn't exactly meant to be world-changing.

You may download the app via the [releases](https://github.com/ahi6/mouse-tracker/releases) tab.
